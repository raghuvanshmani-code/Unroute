# **App Name**: Unroute

## Core Features:

- Awareness and Classification: Capture urge details (type, intensity, context). This works as a form of self-monitoring, a proven technique for behavior change.
- Personalized Intervention Matching: Match users with micro-actions based on their motivation and ability levels (following the Fogg Behavior Model).
- Delay & Checkback: Implement a 'Delay 20 minutes' feature with a timer, incorporating urge-surfing techniques during the delay.
- Implementation Intention Generator: Based on logged triggers, generate personalized 'If X, then I will Y' plans to help users form replacement habits.
- Urge-Surfing/Mindfulness Prompts: Offer short, guided mindfulness scripts. Tool that analyzes user responses to determine if mindfulness exercises are helping reduce urge intensity.
- Progress Tracking and Visualization: Visually display urges resisted vs. acted upon, streaks, triggers, intensity, and time patterns to boost motivation through self-monitoring.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted teal (#63BDBD) for a calming, supportive feel without being cliche.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated teal (#E0F2F7) to create a soothing backdrop.
- Accent color: A soft peach (#FFB347) to draw attention to calls to action without being jarring.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a sans-serif that brings some personality, to use for headings and shorter text.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a serif that brings readability for longer-form content.
- Use simple, clean icons that represent different urge categories.
- Prioritize a clean, uncluttered layout that focuses on the user's current need. Space elements for ease of use.
